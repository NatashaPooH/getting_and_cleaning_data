Raw data set
In order to create a raw data set, the following regular expression was used: -(mean|std)[(]. I.e. all variables containing -mean( or -std( in their names were filtered.
the raw data set contains 68 variables:

subject - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
label - An activity label.
Plus 66 filtered features.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
-XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Tidy data set

Tidy data set contains the same variables as the raw does, but the variables were renamed according to following rules:

All lower case when possible - the variables names were not converted to lower case, since it would make them unreadable. Instead, the variable names were converted to satisfy camlCase rule.
Descriptive (Diagnosis versus Dx) - the variable names are descriptive, so nothing special should be done.
Not duplicated - the variable names are unique, so again nothing special had to be done.
Not have underscores or dots or white spaces - dashes and parentheses were removed from variable names.
To satisfy the requirements above, the following replacements were performed:

Replace -mean with Mean
Replace -std with Std
Remove characters -()
Replace BodyBody with Body
